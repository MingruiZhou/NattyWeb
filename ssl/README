This directory contains modified crypto code from OpenSSL
1.0.0.beta5.  Please see the OpenSSL license from that release in the
OPENSSL-LICENSE which will apply if this code is selected.


Note: It is generally a better idea to link with the latest OpenSSL
library rather than rely on this internal support, as the latest
OpenSSL code may contain important security or other fixes that may
not have been incorporated into this snapshot.  Small device vendors,
however, have requested a stripped down version of the OpenSSL
cryptography code in order to shrink their memory footprint and this
feature provides such support.
